SUWRITE

SUWRITE converts ProMax data to SU format and either writes
it to an SU data file or pipes it into a Unix script file to 
be read by the SU module "suget".  The output from "suget" can 
piped on to other SU modules for further processing prior to
writing an output file.

Parameters:	defaults:		definition:

CHOOSE1		Choose type of input.
		SU_command		Pipe output data to become
					the standard input to this
					SU command.
		SU_data_file  		Will write output data directly 
					to SU file.				
		SU_command_file		Will enter name of SU command 
					file and write output to the 
					SU program suget. (see below)

CMNDFILE	Path to SU command file including file name.

DATAFILE	Path to SU data file including file name.

XDR		Output in XDR (big-endian) format?

SU stands for Seismic Unix which is a collection of public domain
software developed by the Center for Wave Phenomina at the Colorado
School of Mines based on an earlier system developed at Stanford
University.  One can obtain the SU system by anonymous ftp over the
Internet.  Enter

ftp
open hilbert.mines.colorado.edu
cd pub
cd cwpcodes
get README_BEFORE_UNTARRING
get cwp.su.all.21.tar.Z
... you may want to get some of the other files too ...
quit

uncompress cwp.su.all.21.tar.Z
tar -xvf cwp.su.all.21.tar

Then, you have to look at all the installation documentation and
figure out how to compile and link all the modules together.  On
a system where SU is already installed, you can enter "suhelp"
to get a list of available modules or the name of a module without
parameters to get the self documentation for that module.

An example SU script to receive data from an 
external system output module could be:

#! /bin/sh
suget fd=$1 | supswigb > display.ps
exit 0

In this example, the SU module "suget" receives the piped data on the 
Unix file descriptor "$1" passed by ProMax as the first argument to 
the command file.  It pipes the data on to an SU plotting module 
which outputs a postscript file.  On our system, we have a public
domain program called ghostscript which will display a postscript
file on the screen.  To make a screen display of the postscript
file "display.ps" on our system, enter "gs display.ps".  The
standard Unix "lpr" command can be used to send the plot to a
postscript printer.

For our purposes, postscript displays are needed to include in
reports and theses.  The SU system has modules available to make 
postscript wiggle trace, contour, and image displays.  We may
have several versions of swrite in our ProMax menu system with
each pointing to a commonly used command file for a particular
type of display.

The philosophy behind SU is based on modular programs, Unix scripts,
and connecting pipes.  Many SU modules need to be run as part of a 
script that does looping and parameter substitution to be really  
effective, as each module has been kept relatively simple for
tutorial reasons.  This approach allows ProMax data to be piped to 
SU programs and output data files in a flexible manner.  

Note: This documentation assumes the user has knowledge of SU scripts.
