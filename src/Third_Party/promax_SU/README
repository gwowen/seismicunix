This directory holds files for the ProMAX SU interface.

Please note that CWP tries to avoid preferential 
treatment for any contractor system.  The codes here 
were useful for running SU software from within the
ProMAX system available within the CSM environment.
These algorithms could be easily adapted to allow the 
use of SU codes within any other modular contractor system.
